DEMO: https://nasa-search-juanbarbera.vercel.app/

App that consumes an official Nasa API (https://images.nasa.gov/docs/images.nasa.gov_api_docs.pdf). It is responsive like all projects and my first effort into implementing typescript into React, although in this initial phase typescript is not yet being used to its intent. Redux is used to manage data across the four pages (home, results, image display and video display). The loading animation at the results page contains the Earth and the JWSP (James Webb Space Telescope) rotating around it.
